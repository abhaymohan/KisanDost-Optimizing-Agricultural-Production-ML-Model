# Optimizing-Agricultural-Production-ML-Model


 * Logistic Regression | KMeans | scikit-learn | Pandas | Python
 * Developed a machine learning model which suggests the best crop to grow by considering soil condition and climate.
 * Model uses Logistic Regression for prediction.
 * Model uses KMeans for getting insight of data and getting more information about dataset.
 * Model uses scikit-learn library for data processing, feature scaling and for ML algorithms.
